/*using chatgpt i generated data to create a variety of patient information and medications. i did this by asking chatgpt to generate a set of first and last names, 
phone numbers and addresses that could be found in different regions in the USA: midwest, south, west, and east, and date of births between the ages of 17 and 80.

i retreived the information and transferred them into excel to organize the data.

after creating the excel sheets i exported them into csv files and imported them into sqlite studio and created the following scenarios:*/
